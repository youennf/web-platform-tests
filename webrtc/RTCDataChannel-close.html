  6.2. close()

       Closes the RTCDataChannel. It may be called regardless of whether the RTCDataChannel object
       was created by this peer or the remote peer.

       When the close method is called, the user agent MUST run the following steps:

       1. Let channel be the RTCDataChannel object which is about to be closed.
       2. If channel's [[ReadyState]] slot is closing or closed, then abort these steps.
       3. Set channel's [[ReadyState]] slot to closing.
       4. If the closing procedure has not started yet, start it.

  6.2. An RTCDataChannel object's underlying data transport may be torn down in a non-abrupt

/*
  Untestable:

  6.2.
       When an RTCDataChannel object's underlying data transport has been closed, the user agent
       MUST queue a task to run the following steps:

         3. If the transport was closed with an error, fire an RTCError event at channel with
          errorDetail set to "sctp-failure".

       Note: We cannot test this since we cannot provoke an SCTP error.

  6.2.
      In some cases, the user agent may be unable to create an RTCDataChannel's underlying data
      transport. For example, the data channel's id may be outside the range negotiated by the
      [RTCWEB-DATA] implementations in the SCTP handshake. When the user agent determines that an
      RTCDataChannel's underlying data transport cannot be created, the user agent MUST queue a
      task to run the following steps:

      1. Let channel be the RTCDataChannel object for which the user agent could not create an
         underlying data transport.
      2. Set channel's [[ReadyState]] slot to closed.
      3. Fire an RTCError event at channel with errorDetail set to "data-channel-failure".
      4. Fire a simple event named close at channel.

      Note: We cannot test this since there is no way of knowing how many SCTP streams have
            been negotiated.
